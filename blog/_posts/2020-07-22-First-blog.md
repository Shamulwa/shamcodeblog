Hi, everyone! **Welcome to my first blog post** and the **official launch of the SHAM CODE Website**. Hooray! I’m **Sham Mulwa**. A designer who codes. Award-winning Introvert. Coffee practitioner. Amateur gamer. Internet geek. Passionate content creator. And a self-taught web developer (well, the internet taught me)

## WHY I STARTED SHAMCODE BLOG?

I’ve always been one to keep a blog. For so long I have dwelt around the idea of starting one. Held back by the fact that I also wanted to craft the website myself!!!

But why dive into coding when we have **awesome** platforms like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Wix, and the rest? **The answer:** As a web developer, I like to keep all my projects lean and clean. And let's be honest, All those platforms tend to get bloated over time. Themes, plugins, and I could rant about this endlessly.

Few years into web development and am now confident with handling my own code. And oh boy, the joy of writing posts inside my code editor is unmatched by those platforms!!! More on that in another post.

## WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN MY POSTS

I am so excited to share with you MORE of what SHAMCODE BLOG has to offer!

One thing is clear from my google backed research, for me to be successful in this I need to narrow down to a niche, a single topic that I know well enough to blog about. To be honest, that's my absolute downfall!!!

See, there are so many things am interested in. Web design, front-end web development, exploring code, Bit of animation, content creation - for my youtube channel. Just to mention a few, and that's just online!!! Offline, I do lots of coffee brewing.

Dear reader, the articles I write in this blog will be broad. It's okay if you come across an article that seems off-topic. You should, however, expect mostly tech related posts. Maybe ill find my niche along the way.

Finally, I envision that with time SHAM CODE blog will be full of helpful and inspiring content that people all over the world could read and appreciate.
