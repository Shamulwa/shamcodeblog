Hi, everyone! **Welcome to my first blog post** and the **official launch of the SHAM CODE Website**. Hooray! I’m **Sham Mulwa**. A designer who codes. Award-winning Introvert. Coffee practitioner. Amateur gamer. Internet geek. Passionate content creator. And a self-taught web developer (well, the internet taught me)

## WHY I STARTED SHAMCODE BLOG?

I’ve always been one to keep a blog. For so long I have dwelt around the idea of starting one. Held back by the fact that I also wanted to craft the website myself!!!

But why dive into coding when we have **awesome** platforms like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Wix, and the rest? **The answer:** As a web developer, I like to keep all my projects lean and clean. And let's be honest, All those platforms tend to get bloated over time. Themes, plugins, and I could rant about this endlessly.

Few years into web development and am now confident with handling my own code. And oh boy, the joy of writing posts inside my code editor is unmatched by those platforms!!! - More of a personal personal prefrence.

I am so excited to share with you MORE of what SHAMCODE BLOG has to offer!

## WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN MY POSTS

One thing is clear from my (google backed) research, for me to be successful in this I need to narrow down to a **niche**, a single topic that I know well enough to blog about. To be honest, that's my absolute downfall!!!

See, there are **so many things** am interested in. Web design, front-end web development, exploring code, Bit of animation, content creation. Just to mention a few, and thats all just online!!! Offline, I do lots of coffee brewing.

**Disclaimer**, the articles I write in this blog will be broad. It's okay if you come across an article that seems off-topic. You should, however, expect mostly **tech related** posts. Maybe ill find my niche along the way.

Finally, I **envision** that with time SHAM CODE blog will be full of helpful and inspiring content that people all over the world could read and appreciate.

## CONTACT ME

It would be lovely to engage with you, hear **your thoughts**, **suggestions**, and maybe **share ideas**. You can reach me on almost all of the common social media platforms or **mail me** at shammulwa@gmail.com

Thank you, come again.

Sincerely,

**SHAM MULWA**
